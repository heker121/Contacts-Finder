<h1> Contacts Finder </h1>
<h3>Email's, Number's and other stuff.</h3>

<p>Simple App that searches through Mongo database and shows all Staff that works at our place. You can get their Name, Phone, Email, Position, Building, PC Nr., IP Address. 
I Have not added way to create person through form. I just create new Person in seeds.js and uncomment line in App.js.</p>

<p>Most of Staff is still used to look on piece of paper for number so i created a PDF generator. In right corner they can
generate always up to date PDF and download it to their PC so they can print it out later on. </p>
